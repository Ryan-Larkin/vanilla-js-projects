<!--When we click "Get Weather!" right now, there is no indication that the browser is doing anything useful. If the two API calls take more than a few milliseconds to run, we will not see what is going on. This is bad for the user experience. If you look at the GIF at the beginning of this seciton, you'll notice that after entering a city name the word "loading..." appears below, to be replaced by the result when it arrives. Implement this in your own app.-->
<!--Add CSS to make it look nice! Here, the sky is the limit ;) Bigger fonts, custom fonts, custom colors and backgrounds. You can use the Skycons icons since the API returns an icon property in the data. You could also look for another set of icons that is more original or in line with the style of your app.-->
<!--Add more weather information. The currently section contains the wind speed, wind direction, and many other interesting bits of information about the weather. Find a nice way to display them and do it!-->
<!--Add a five-day forecast to your application with its own styling and icons.-->
<!--When geocoding, we are taking the first result that Google Maps API gives us. Inside this result there is the full name of the location that we requested. For example if you query for address=montreal, the response will contain the string Montreal, QC, Canada. Use this to display it along with your weather information.-->
<!--Use Google Places Autocomplete to provide an input box that will suggest options to the user. This is better than "guessing" what the user wanted to type, and will make you learn about a new API.-->

<!--CSS Plans:-->
<!--Background picture/looping gif depending on weather state-->
<!--Center the form, make it look nice-->
